                <p>Recommended security tips:

                    <br>- Never share your password with anyone.

                        <br>- Use a combination of upper and lowercase letters as well as numbers to create a password that is hard to guess.

                            <br>- Change your passwords regularly, and never use the same password for multiple sites.

                            </p>
